                <p className="text-[1.6em]">
                    I've spent the last 10 years as a remote full-stack engineer
                    creating dozens of websites, apps, games, IoT hardware,
                    AR/VR experiences, and a couple of startups along the way.
                    I've pushed myself to learn the latest in modern
                    technologies to bring my best to the table. I have the
                    advantage of being a very fast learner, can wear multiple
                    hats, and can put myself in almost any situation needed.
                    Lately, I've started my adventure into the Metaverse as a
                    game developer for Cool Cats; one of the largest NFT players
                    in the space. Check them out and see some of my work:
                    CoolCatsNFT.com

            </div>
        </div>
    );
